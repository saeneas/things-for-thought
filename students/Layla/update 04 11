I would like to create a method of information transfer, e.g. an app, game, chatbot etc, to help a child whose parent/friend/relative has had a stroke understand what this means, answer their questions and hopefully give them the tools to be able to understand and cope with the situation.
It is incredibly difficult for a child in this position to understand what is happening, and most resources and information present are sterile, medical and inaccessible for young people.
The information in my project will be presented as if it is coming from someone of a similar age, who has experienced the same thing, rather than from a parent or medical professional.

It should be clear, easy to understand, use simple language and have attractive graphics. Information should be digestible and from a reliable source, e.g. The Stroke Association. It should be presented in a kind, friendly way, but not be sugar-coated.
It should give the child a 'friend' to inform and reassure them, and primarily give them the feeling that they are not alone, and not at fault.

I need to think about what I want this project to become, in what form it should be and how I can best achieve this.
I need to get in contact with stroke experts, stroke survivors and their families, potentially a child psychologist and maybe a graphic designer or developer for advice.
I am also open to this project being about illnesses in general, not so specific to stroke, and I am open to whatever form fits it the best.
