Base Idea started in handheld bacteria scanner -- stuck at finding parts for the assembly. 
Alternative pov - Mushroom identifier, eg tool for hunter gatherers - going back to the roots.

After reading part of "an Immense World" (some snakes hunt through detecting vibrations and subtle movements that accompany heartbeats) 
and the talk about how much more sensitive api could be to the data given, I have started research about how unique a heartbeat could be to a person, 
and how well is this point researched or used.

possible compact modules for teaching and use - 
  • AD8232 Heart Rate Monitor/ECG Sensor: A low-power ECG sensor capable of detecting heart rate and waveform patterns, ideal for creating unique heartbeat profiles.
  • MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter and Heart-Rate Sensor: Measures oxygen saturation and heart rate via optical sensors, commonly used in wearables for real-time monitoring.
  • MPU6050 Gyroscope/Accelerometer: Provides motion and vibration data, useful for detecting subtle body movements associated with cardiac activity.
  • Panasonic ERT-J0EG103FA NTC Thermistor: Measures temperature changes, which could support tracking physiological variations in health monitoring contexts.

interesting use case for me - as a part of adventure/going back to the roots point, obtaining bigger connection with items which don't posses as much weight nowadays 
as they did in the past like a knife which unlocks after hearing the heart of the owner. (not practical, more "symbolic")


side research / ideas - things for thoughts
  • Tools for protests
  • Signs catcher (Sensors and mainly all tech like good example a flipper zero sense the world in a complete different way from human 5 senses - a device that would catch Signs
  • patterns somewhat spiritual mimicking human tendency to look for signs)
  • spiral dynamics developmental levels
    Mind maps
  • Digital Ethnography

Read - 
Carrier bag theory of fiction - 
Very interesting, It reminded me of a quote I had saved on tumbler a while ago (i'm still using tumbler not ashamed of it) and apparently its also hers from another book

  " We have been so desensitised by a hundred and fifty years of ceaselessly expanding technical prowess that we think nothing less complex and 
  showy than a computer or a jet bomber deserves to be called "technology" at all. As if linen were the same thing as flax — 
  as if paper, ink, wheels, knives, clocks, chairs, aspirin pills, were natural objects, born with us like our teeth and fingers as if
  steel saucepans with copper bottoms and fleece vests spun from recycled glass grew on trees, and we just picked them when they were ripe... "

Some metaphysical aspects of the Knife - Im not sure if its going to end up being a knife but for now Ill stick with the word. 
Its very special to me how after death, the knife in a way kind of dies with the owner. 
Opening up an old way of interaction with the object in order to operate it, in some sense unearthing a buried instinct deep in our psyche. 
a relic of ancient times, would it be from years of infants held close to the hearts of parents or long past ceremonies, agricultural and daily activities, 
whatever the root - The action remains a kind of innate behaviour that most scratches across time.

In a way bringing an “innovation” to this ancient act, reshapes the interaction. 
We still reach out, Hold near and almost try to become one with an object but this time they respond, 
React in the same way holding you themselves sharing with you the same attachment.

  https://github.com/SoufianeDataFan/ECG-authentificate (very useful)

Very important I think to have data not only from finger/pulse but needing to bring an item close to the heart. As ecg needs three connections attached all over your body
Im looking into if the combined data from Single-Lead ECG and PPG Combination Sensor would be enough.

11.11.2024 - 22.11.2024

Bought parts - arriving tomorrow
remaining - Button  
            Vibration module
            Battery (already emailed grepow)
            Solenoid lock
            vibration module (ask which one)

Today - 
  Tasks:
    Figure out how to implement the git (choose the one working) : for now sticking with - axelmukwena
    What data should I use
        for now exploring only using ESG
        after vibration
        after vibration and PPG

So far - 
  ECG scan should be easy enough after reading through the file, Iv set up the "Cardiochip" adding MIT-BIH Dataset of ECG scans. (feel like a Cardiologist)
  Problem - If I want to use ECG scan the electrodes need to be either attached directly to skin, or through embeding textile electrodes in the shirt.
  Also if I need to proceed with ECG the sensor I bought won't be clear enough if its even working at all the bsd101 costs 70 euro which is doable if I make up
  my mind about using ECG - but first I'll try with the cheaper one. - but this is basically ready made solution https://shorturl.at/E9aD3

Ordered BMD101 so the technical side should be done by now not including understanding the code.


Iv left the knife behind - I do want to get back to it on my own, but that should be easy as by then Ill have the hardware part pointed down. I do understand the 
irelevancy of industrilising a knife nowdays, maybe it is not the right time in history for the relevency it had, from back in the days Beyond its practical use, 
such daggers where a symbol of honor and heritage, often passed down through generations as a family heirloom. After some reflection and fighting through many brain fogs - 
Iv narrowd down the direction I want to go into - we did joke around with the idea of making a key, a purse small locket but ultimatly I don't think either of those objects
need an imeddiete lock nor do they requere the connection I seek. 

Ultimately, I’m leaning toward creating a cardholder/Bitcoin wallet as a modern everyday carry essential that I think actually needs security - I think in this process I might
have lost a conceptual side or have a different perespective on what counts as good concept.

Possessions have always been median in how we see ourselves. They are the tangible expressions of identity, carried through life as we grow up. 
For kids and adults, possessions are tools for exploring and communicating who they are becoming, means of connecting to themselves and to the social 
world around them. In later life - possessions take a deeper meaning, helping elderly preserve a sense of continuity starched across their timeline. 
Anchoring memories which serve as a sort of a bridge, between past, present and imagined future. Providing framework for contemplating mortality by holding onto legacy.

In today’s world our connection to the material is shifting. The rise of fast consumption through social media and marketing, are ever so accelerated. 
We have been distanced from the physical world. Objects are no longer valued for their longevity or the link we develop with them, but rather - their 
social status and fleeting utility. By continuing this cycle we risk being disconnected from the material world and what it once offered - a sense of 
stability and authenticity, a way to express yourself while staying true to yourself.

The concept of a bond with an object should be one of the steps in accomplishing, personal connections once held with objects. 
Rather than being commodities, these possessions become collaborators in shaping identity. Forming a connection that is truly personal and not fully utilitarian. 
The act of being chosen creates a profound emotional connection - it insists a sense of worth, and uniqueness of the situation as if the object recognises and gives 
feedback to the user without actually being technologically skewed. Object shapes the owner while the owner fulfills its purpose.
