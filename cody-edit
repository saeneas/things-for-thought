# things-for-thought

Welcome to the official things-for-thought course page!
There's not much here to see but this:

### 🔮 🗡️ Side Quest 🗡️ 🔮 ### 
Until next week, make a pull request to this repository by editing this file!
There are a couple ways to do it:

🐇 **Beginner mode:** Sign up to GitHub, make a change to this file and propose a change.

🐗 **Intermediate mode:** Sign up to GitHub, fork this repository, open it in a GitHub Codespace, make the changes there and make the pull request.

🦖 **Hard mode:** Sign up to GitHub, download the VS Code IDE, and do it from there..

I will leave it to you to research how this exactly works :-) Learning how git works is probably one of the best covered topics on youtube. There's also interactive tutorials out there.
Most importantly - help each other figuring it out. If you don't succeed, reach out to your fellow students!
The more people solve it the better! One last thing.. GitHub is a powerful tool you can do a lot with, so don't get caught up in understanding it in it's entirety.

To kick off the un(learning) learning theme of our course, try to approach the task through this lense.
- What is Git? And how is it different from GitHub?
- Why do you think does every programmer use it?
- Why might it be designed the way it is designed?
- How could it help you?

🍀 ** good luck **
